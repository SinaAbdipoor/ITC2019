# ITC2019
International Timetabling Competition 2019

This project aims to study the International Timetabling Competition 2019 (ITC 2019) and its dataset.

The main objectives are to:
1) Understand the XML structure of the dataset and load it;
2) Model and store the problem instances efficiently for manuplation;
3) Encode and model a candidate solution;
4) Test different optimization methods and provide a sample solution;
5) Save and store a candidate solution (timetable) in the required XML format, and submit it to the online validator using the ITC2019 API.
